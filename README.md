**GREENLEAF-PROJECT**

GreenLeaf Completion is a business analytics project transforming raw sales data into insights with KPIs, pivot tables &amp; dashboards. It tracks revenue, profit, customer trends &amp; shipment status, helping uncover product performance &amp; drive data-driven decisions.
This project, GreenLeaf Completion, is a comprehensive business analytics solution built on real-world transactional sales data from GreenLeaf, a sustainable and eco-friendly product distributor. The project focuses on transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights through structured cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

The dataset captures detailed order-level information, including product categories, unit prices, costs, customer demographics, states, and shipment statuses. From this foundation, the project progresses through several structured stages:

**Raw Data Compilation**– Collection of customer orders, product details, and fulfillment statuses.

**Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Standardization of inconsistent text fields, correction of anomalies, and organization into structured formats suitable for analysis.

**KPI Tracking** – Calculation of essential business metrics such as revenue, cost, profit margin, and product performance across different categories.

**Exploratory Analysis** – Pivot tables and aggregated metrics provide visibility into sales distribution by state, shipment efficiency, and customer purchase behaviors.

**Dashboard Creation** – A visually interactive dashboard consolidates all insights, offering a real-time overview of business performance to support data-driven decision-making.

The objective of this project is not only to highlight financial performance but also to provide a framework for operational monitoring. By leveraging structured Excel workflows—including clean datasets, pivot analysis, and visualization—the project demonstrates how raw, unstructured data can be transformed into a decision-support system for business leaders.

Key questions addressed in this project include:

Which product categories drive the highest profitability?

How do shipment statuses impact customer satisfaction and returns?

Which states and regions contribute most to sales performance?

What patterns can be observed in customer purchase frequency and product preferences?

This repository is designed as a blueprint for anyone seeking to perform end-to-end sales analytics using Excel. It demonstrates best practices in dataset preparation, KPI reporting, and dashboarding, making it valuable for data analysts, business strategists, and students exploring real-world applications of data-driven decision-making.
